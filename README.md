Projcet Name: International Education Agency Management System
The International Education Management System is a comprehensive educational platform that begins with a welcoming interface featuring a button that leads to the contributor information page. Users are then directed to a login page where they can choose between user and admin access. New users have the option to create an account through the registration panel. The admin portal provides access to an administrative dashboard where they can view and manage all user information and payment records. Regular users, upon successful login, are taken to their personal dashboard where they have two main options: they can either purchase educational courses or apply to study in one of five different countries. This streamlined system effectively manages both the educational course marketplace and international study applications in a single, user-friendly interface.
